# Count Single Double Positive
This Fiji (ImageJ) Macro was develeoped in collaboration with Daniela Ivan, Locatelli Group, Thedor Kocher Institute.

The main idea is to quantify how many single or double positive cells are present in specific areas of mouse brain sections. 

The macro goes through all the images inside a folder and, after asking the user to specify the ROIs, it counts all single positive cells (for 2 independent channels) and all double positive cells (for those 2 channels). 

In the end it saves results in CSV format and the count (binary) masks in tiff format.
